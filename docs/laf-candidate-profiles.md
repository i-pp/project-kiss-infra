# Explicit Ollama-only Core acceptance candidate

## Busy-reader summary

This isolated candidate can exercise named small Ollama models through the actual
Core entrypoint without starting Flash or borrowing a production profile name.
The existing default remains Flash plus `coder-next` and `gpt-oss-120b`.
Nothing here selects or changes an installed service, downloads a model, or gives
Core Docker access.

Run the focused checks from this candidate directory:

```sh
LAF_TEST_LIVE_UDS=1 python3 -B -m unittest -v \
  inference.aceis_service.test_acceptance_profiles
LAF_TEST_LIVE_UDS=1 python3 -B -m unittest -v \
  inference.aceis_service.test_lifecycle \
  inference.aceis_service.test_lifecycle_uds \
  inference.aceis_service.test_lifecycle_uds_live \
  inference.aceis_service.test_host_supervisor \
  inference.aceis_service.test_core_integration \
  inference.aceis_service.test_service \
  inference.aceis_service.test_acceptance_profiles \
  inference.local_platform.test_models
```

These are offline fake-provider checks, including real private Unix sockets and
owned fake Flash subprocesses in the inherited regression suite. They are not
actual model inference or a complete runtime Quick Start. Container build,
curated download, actual multi-model inference, replacement and persistence
checks belong to the separate host acceptance driver and its evidence.

## One explicit opt-in configuration

An owner-only mode-0600 Core configuration may instead contain exactly
`state_dir`, `runtime_dir`, `lifecycle_runtime_dir`, `acceptance_ollama_profiles`,
and optionally `npu_socket`. All paths retain the container-native absolute-path
rule. Strata fields are rejected in this mode, which removes ambiguity about
whether Flash should start. Without `acceptance_ollama_profiles`, the original
required fields and Flash behavior are unchanged.

Each acceptance profile has exactly `id`, `reference`, and `options`. The example
below shows the schema, not verified model installation or deployment settings:

```json
{
  "state_dir": "/state",
  "runtime_dir": "/runtime",
  "lifecycle_runtime_dir": "/lifecycle",
  "acceptance_ollama_profiles": [
    {
      "id": "test-qwen25-05b",
      "reference": "qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct-q4_K_M",
      "options": {
        "num_ctx": 8192,
        "num_thread": 2,
        "num_batch": 32,
        "num_gpu": 32,
        "temperature": 0,
        "seed": 42
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "test-smollm2-135m",
      "reference": "smollm2:135m-instruct-q4_K_M",
      "options": {
        "num_ctx": 8192,
        "num_thread": 2,
        "num_batch": 32,
        "num_gpu": 32,
        "temperature": 0,
        "seed": 42
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The catalog permits 1..8 unique `test-` IDs, lowercase letters/digits/hyphens,
and distinct exact tagged references. References cannot contain URLs, ports,
paths outside a single optional model namespace, whitespace, or arbitrary
commands. The tag may use uppercase characters because actual Ollama
quantization tags do. No production ID can be reused.

All option keys are required. `num_ctx` must remain 8192 to match the unchanged
public context-budget validator. Integer bounds are `num_thread` 1..32,
`num_batch` 1..512, `num_gpu` 0..256, and `seed` 0..2147483647. Temperature is a
finite number in 0..2; booleans are not accepted as numbers. Thinking remains
false, streaming false and keep-alive fixed at -1. Only the existing bounded
`max_tokens` request supplies `num_predict`.

Public job requests still allow only `model`, `messages`, `max_tokens` and
`timeout_seconds`. `/v1/models`, `/v1/capabilities` and Controller validation
use the selected instance catalog. The legacy CLI's fixed choices are unchanged;
acceptance uses bounded private UDS requests directly.

## Provider readiness and release

Startup still requires the mapped owner UID, a separate PID namespace, the
host's fixed emergency-stop capability, and an authenticated physical stop
barrier. It then starts the fixed host-owned Ollama provider and verifies that
the exact configured references appear in `/api/tags`.

Before accepting requests, Ollama-only mode requires empty `/api/ps`, physical
VRAM below 3 GiB and available RAM at least 8 GiB twice. The resulting host
observations form its empty-engine baseline, using the lower VRAM and higher RAM
values. The baseline is invalidated by any abort and recaptured before a later
load. A concurrent provider stop invalidates baseline publication.

Switching first unloads the exact configured old reference. It requires empty
`/api/ps`, VRAM within 512 MiB of that baseline and below 3 GiB, and available RAM
within 2 GiB of baseline and never below 8 GiB, twice. Missing or unconfirmed
physical release prevents the next model load. After generation, the sole
loaded reference must be the requested configured reference. Default Flash
switching keeps its existing Flash baseline and options.

Candidate readiness does not require Flash. It requires verified startup
catalog/baseline state, no local stop/close, and a fresh authenticated host status
confirming the same host epoch, running provider and no stop or safety fault.
This is provider readiness, not a token-generation probe. No independent
network health request can overwrite the active cancellable inference
connection. Normal abort and close still use the host's physical release stop
barrier; there is no fallback to local telemetry or host PID signaling.

## Boundaries and verification limits

The Core image's existing ten-file source allowlist is unchanged. There are no
new dependencies, lifecycle operations, public listeners, Docker commands,
mount authorities or host socket authorities in Core. The copied v2 local model
manager is unchanged and is not included in the Core image. Its installation
catalog, manifest digest checks and persistent registry are independent of this
Core selection catalog.

The source was copied from the preserved smoke source into a new candidate.
Original source and production settings remain untouched. The inherited
`source-manifest.json` and `verification/core` describe the earlier snapshot;
new candidate evidence is under `verification/candidate`. Test success alone is
not a P0 acceptance result or evidence of model provenance.
