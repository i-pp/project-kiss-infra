# Local AI Fabric naming and compatibility

## Names

The agreed product names are:

| Scope | Display name |
| --- | --- |
| Independent local AI development platform | Local AI Fabric (LAF) |
| Guarded inference service | LAF Router |
| MCP integration | LAF MCP |

Use these English names in new product documentation. They do not rename the
separate AceIS implementation or change historical evidence. Preserve original
names in dated acceptance records, logs, upstream references and quoted output.

## Compatibility boundary

This first change covers documentation and the description in the example user
unit. It does not deploy a renamed service, update the installed MCP App, or
create new transports or access. The example unit retains its existing filename
and `ExecStart`; applying it to a host is a separate operation.

Keep these identifiers unchanged:

| Identifier | Existing value or scope |
| --- | --- |
| Client modules | `inference.local_platform.*` |
| Router modules | `inference.aceis_service.*` |
| GPU user unit | `aceis-inference.service` |
| GPU socket | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aceis-inference/service.sock` |
| NPU unit and socket | Existing independent NPU deployment identifiers |
| Client socket override | `LOCAL_INFERENCE_SOCKET` and `--socket` |
| HTTP routes and JSON fields | Existing v1 API in [API.md](API.md) |
| Model/profile IDs | Existing IDs; display naming does not add models |
| MCP tool names | Existing names, including `aceis_local_*` and `codex_*` |
| MCP server identity | Existing `serverInfo.name` and protocol metadata |
| App/plugin identity | Existing App/plugin IDs and package name |
| State and ownership | Existing paths, locks, labels and owned-container checks |

Do not replace `aceis` strings globally. Some belong to the separate AceIS
implementation; others bind clients, allowlists, state, resource ownership or
rollback to the running deployment. A new brand is not an API migration.

## Display rollout still to perform

1. Review and accept this documentation and example-description change.
2. Update remaining CLI help or other user-visible labels in the owning source,
   with focused regression tests and the same ASCII-only code convention.
3. Rename the existing MCP App presentation from `AceIS MCP Dev` to `LAF MCP`
   through its supported owning App workflow. Preserve App/plugin identity,
   audience, connection, authentication, tool names and permissions. A generated
   local plugin-cache manifest is not the editable source of truth.
4. If changing an installed systemd description, inspect and back up that unit,
   keep its unit name and command unchanged, and arrange any required reload or
   restart separately. Do not interrupt active inference merely for branding.
5. Read the displayed names back in the intended host. A saved source label is
   not proof that an installed App or running process has adopted it.

The existing MCP integration and the new private Router service are separate
integration boundaries. Renaming both does not assert that MCP has been rewired
to the new Router. Validate any such rewiring as an independent implementation
change.

## Verification and later distribution

For the documentation-only patch, check patch applicability, links, unchanged
command examples and compatibility identifiers. Runtime tests are required for
later source or deployment changes; documentation checks alone cannot pass them.

Before introducing new package, executable, image, repository or service names,
choose the exact names and a compatibility/rollback policy. Docker Hub release,
public networking, credentials, persistent access and permission changes remain
separate decisions. The existing deployment procedure is not a complete fresh-host
Quick Start. Continue using [the distribution checklist](../aceis_service/distribution-notes.md)
before proposing a portable release.
